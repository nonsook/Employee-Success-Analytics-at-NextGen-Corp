## Employeee Retention Analysis

In order to get answers for this analysis, I asked the following questions, and got answers using the queries below:

The top 5 highest serving employees are:

1. David Moore (Highest)
2. John Johnson
3. Frank Johnson
4. Jane Lee
5. Eve Wilson

The Marketing department has an extremely high turnover rate of 92%. Almost the entire department has left.
This could indicate low morale, management, or role-related issues, or external opportunities pulling employees away. 

Engineering has moderate to high turnover (66%).
This level suggests instability or possible issues in workload, culture, or retention incentives. Given the normal high demand for engineers, this may also reflect competitive poaching.

Sales and HR show healthy or manageable turnover (Both 27%). These departments are within a more typical industry range (10 - 30%, depending on the sector).

A deeper query on the turnover table shows that 21 out of the 28 employees who left all had an average performance score of  4.0 and above. 5 were retirees, while the remaining 16 people left for either personal reasons, career growth or they found another job.

So, it means that high performers are actually the ones with a high risk of leaving the company. 

This could be due to a feeling of not being adequately compensated for their hard work, or a poor work culture.
